		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This recipe describes how to make a skillet lasagna. It is no-bake, made on the stovetop and a much better alternative than buying one from the store!</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
			<li>1/2 (28 ounce) jar of spaghetti sauce</li>
			<li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
			<li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
			<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
			<li>2 cups dried malfada noodles</li>
			<li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons dried basil (optional)</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
			<li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
			<li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
			<li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
